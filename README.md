# LinkedIn-Job-Applier

This Python program automates the process of applying to LinkedIn job posts that require only minimal details like contact information, resume, and cover letter. The program uses the Selenium package to log in to LinkedIn and navigate to the job application page. It then fills in the required fields and submits the application. This can save time and effort for job seekers who want to apply to multiple job posts on LinkedIn.
